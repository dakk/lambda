```ocaml
let t = Abs("x",Abs("y",Var "x"));; 
let f = Abs("x",Abs("y",Var "y"));;
(* (λx.(λy.((y x) y))) *)
let fand = (Abs ("x", (Abs("y", App(App(Var "y", Var "x"), Var "y"))))) in
let fand_app a b = App(App(fand, Bool.of_bool a), Bool.of_bool b) in
Printf.printf "%b and %b => %b\n" true true (Bool.to_bool @@ L.reduce_fix @@ fand_app true true);
Printf.printf "%b and %b => %b\n" true false (Bool.to_bool @@ L.reduce_fix @@ fand_app true false);
